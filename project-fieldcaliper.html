        <h1>X-series Charging Station</h1>
        
        <p>The E2 is an AC charging station for electric vehicles, designed primarily for home use. Key features include compatibility with home batteries and solar. This is the second charger I have designed and the main design challenges focussed on creating a minimalistic form, reducing the size and creating an intuitive user experience.</p>

        <p>The approximate form was decided early on - it's important to me that a charger has an architectural aesthetic as opposed to a transport design aesthetic. A charger is generally part of the house and should reflect that. Three spines triangulate the front, increasing rigidity while maintaining a clean form</p>

            <img src="images/fieldcaliper-5.jpg" alt="Project 1 detail 4">
        </div>

        <p>The process of converting this into an injection molded design that was cost effective was a difficult process as there were many design features we wanted to include to increase durability and improve the installation process. Two examples: There is an internal cover which seals the electronics, increasing protection while simplifying the installation process via a smaller terminal cover. We also wanted three routing options, top, rear and bottom. The top option was a hard problem as we had to assume imperfect sealing and that water could run down into the enclosure.</p>
