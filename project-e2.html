        <h1>E2 charger</h1>
        
        <p>Team:
            Ashley Duncan - Firmware & electronics design
            Bart Wennmeckers - Hardware & electronics design
            The E2 is an AC charging station for electric vehicles, designed primarily for home use. Key features include 
            compatibility with home batteries and solar. This is the second charger I have designed and the main design 
            challenges focussed on creating a minimalistic form, reducing the size and creating an intuitive user experience.</p>

        <p>It's important to me that a charger has an architectural aesthetic as opposed to a transport design 
            aesthetic.A charger is generally part of the house and should reflect that. Three spines triangulate 
            the front, increasing rigidity while maintaining a clean form, with directional cues towards the central cable.</p>

        <p>The process of converting this into a cost effective injection molded design was a difficult process as there were 
            many design features we wanted to include to increase durability and improve the installation process. 
            Two examples: There is an internal cover which seals the electronics, increasing protection while simplifying 
            the installation process via a smaller terminal cover. We also wanted three routing options, top, rear and bottom. 
            The top option was a hard problem as we had to assume imperfect sealing and that water could run down into the enclosure. </p>
