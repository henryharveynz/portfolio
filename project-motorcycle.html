        <p><h3>Introduction</h3>These bikes are practical engineering and electronics projects, not industrial design focused. I 
            completed the first one over 10 years ago and it has been road registered and used as a commuter in Nelson and Christchurch. 
            The farm bike was completed in mid 2025 and is currently being used on my parents high country farm in Marlborough.</p><!-- More first column content here. -->

    <div>
        <p>Both bikes have been built from individual components and have increased my electronics knowledge hugely. I also taught myself to weld and machine through building these.</p><!-- Second column content here. -->

        <p>I have a strong interest in transport design, especially electric. The farm bike has totally convinced me that farm bikes 
            are a great application for electric power. My bike has a battery pack I built myself, from nearly 400 batteries, spot welded 
            together with a welder I built myself from a microwave transformer. Yet it has good power, no clutch or gears, regeneration 
            down hills and no noise from an engine or a flopping chain.  </p>
