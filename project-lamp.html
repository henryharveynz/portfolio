            <h3>Introduction</h3><p>Long term personal project. A desk lamp designed to be producable at low volumes with a focus on high quality materials, 
            tactile use and a very long lifespan. Key features include ability to accurately position lamp, balanced mechanical 
            aesthetic and use of easy access technology such as LEDs, Edison fittings, USB-C power connector and CNC wood lathes.<!-- First column content here. -->

        <p>An aim of this design is to not require high skill in "craft" in order to produce multiples of object. While the first prototypes were built by 
            hand using a lathe, the end goal is to showcase the simplicity and beauty of materials and the condensation? of a considered? design theme 
            borrowing from the Anglepoise? lamp design</p><!-- More first column content here. -->

        <p>The first prototype has been built and the overall balance, mechanical movement and assembly has been evaluated. I deem it a very successful first step 
            as it answered many questions and gave a clear design path: reduce part numbers, resolve routing for power cable, refine switch design, reduce number 
            of wooden parts to improve manufacturability and specify bulb choice to allow final dimensions to be locked in.</p><!-- Second column content here. -->

        <p>The process of converting this into a cost effective injection molded design was a difficult process as there were 
            many design features we wanted to include to increase durability and improve the installation process. 
            Two examples: There is an internal cover which seals the electronics, increasing protection while simplifying 
            the installation process via a smaller terminal cover. We also wanted three routing options, top, rear and bottom. 
            The top option was a hard problem as we had to assume imperfect sealing and that water could run down into the enclosure. </p>
